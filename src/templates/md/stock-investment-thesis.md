Create a comprehensive investment thesis for [Company Name] ([Stock Code]).

Core Thesis:

- Articulate the single most important factor—either an opportunity or a threat—that the market consensus appears to be mispricing or overlooking.

Valuation Analysis:

- Provide valuation estimates using three distinct methodologies: one intrinsic (cash-flow based), one relative (market-based), and one based on assets or earnings power.
- State the resulting average intrinsic value per share.
- Quantify the margin of safety based on the current market price.

Recommendation & Key Risks:

- Verdict: State a clear recommendation: Buy, Hold, or Avoid.
- Time Horizon: Specify the recommended investment horizon in years.
- Thesis Breakers: List the top 2-3 specific risks that would fundamentally invalidate your core thesis.
