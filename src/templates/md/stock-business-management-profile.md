Write an investigative feature on [Company Name] ([Stock Code]) in the style of a top-tier business journal.

Your mission is to uncover the company's core narrativeâ€”the story behind the official one. Make it a compelling read, not a dull summary.

Focus your investigation on these four areas:

- Genesis & Evolution: Describe its origin story and the key strategic pivots that have shaped its identity.
- The Business & Its Critics: Analyze the problem the company solves and its value proposition. Then, contrast this with the sharpest criticisms of its business model or products.
- The Competitive Moat: Identify its primary competitive advantage. Provide a narrative showing whether this moat is widening, stable, or shrinking amid major industry trends.
- Leadership & Power: Investigate who holds real power and influence. Evaluate the reputation of the leadership based on their track record. Then, analyze a defining strategic move from the past three to five years by comparing its stated rationale to the actual outcome.

Strict Constraints:

- Style: Purely qualitative. Exclude all financial metrics, valuations, and price commentary.
- Sources: Prioritize independent, critical sources over company marketing materials.
